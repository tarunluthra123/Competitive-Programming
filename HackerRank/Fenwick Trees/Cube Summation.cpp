Cube Summation


You are given a 3-D Matrix in which each block contains 0 initially. The first block is defined by the coordinate (1,1,1) and the last block is defined by the coordinate (N,N,N). There are two types of queries.

UPDATE x y z W
updates the value of block (x,y,z) to W.

QUERY x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2
calculates the sum of the value of blocks whose x coordinate is between x1 and x2 (inclusive), y coordinate between y1 and y2 (inclusive) and z coordinate between z1 and z2 (inclusive).

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test-cases. T testcases follow.
For each test case, the first line will contain two integers N and M separated by a single space.
N defines the N * N * N matrix.
M defines the number of operations.
The next M lines will contain either

 1. UPDATE x y z W
 2. QUERY  x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 
Output Format
Print the result for each QUERY.

Constrains
1 <= T <= 50
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= M <= 1000
1 <= x1 <= x2 <= N
1 <= y1 <= y2 <= N
1 <= z1 <= z2 <= N
1 <= x,y,z <= N
-109 <= W <= 109

Explanation
First test case, we are given a cube of 4 * 4 * 4 and 5 queries. Initially all the cells (1,1,1) to (4,4,4) are 0.
UPDATE 2 2 2 4 makes the cell (2,2,2) = 4
QUERY 1 1 1 3 3 3. As (2,2,2) is updated to 4 and the rest are all 0. The answer to this query is 4.
UPDATE 1 1 1 23. updates the cell (1,1,1) to 23. QUERY 2 2 2 4 4 4. Only the cell (1,1,1) and (2,2,2) are non-zero and (1,1,1) is not between (2,2,2) and (4,4,4). So, the answer is 4.
QUERY 1 1 1 3 3 3. 2 cells are non-zero and their sum is 23+4 = 27.
