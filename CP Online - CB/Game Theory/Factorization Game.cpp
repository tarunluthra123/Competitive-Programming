/*
Factorization Game
Mancunian and his arch-enemy Liverbird are playing a game. They have a multiset of positive integers available and they alternate turns. Mancunian always starts.

Each move consists of choosing some prime number p and then choosing a non-empty subset of the multiset such that each element of the subset is divisible by p. Then, the player divides each member of the subset by some non-zero power of p.

Note that the element must be divisible by pa if you are performing division by pa For example, if the chosen prime is 3 then 18 is divisible by 9 but not by 27 Also, it is not necessary to divide each element of the subset with the same power of p.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of elements in the multiset S The second line of each test case contains N integers denoting the elements of the multiset.

Constraints
1=T=20 1=N=10000 1 <= each element <= 10^6

Output Format
For each test case, print the name of the winning player in a new line.

Sample Input
2
4
1 2 3 5
4
3 18 2 2
Sample Output
Mancunian
Liverbird
Explanation
Consider the first case. In the first move, Mancunian chooses one prime from the set {2, 3, 5}. If he chooses 2, then he has to choose the subset containing only the value 2 from the array and divide it by 2. In the next move, Liverbird chooses one of the primes {3, 5}. If he chooses 3, then he has to choose the subset containing only the value 3 from the array and divide it by 3. In the last move, Mancunian repeats the same with the prime 5. Liverbird cannot make a move and he loses. All other possible paths of the game are analogous to this one.
