/*
The Game Of Stones - 1
Two players (numbered 1 and 2) are playing a game with stones. Player 1 always plays first, and the two players move in alternating turns. The game's rules are as follows:

In a single move, a player can remove either 2,3,or 5 stones from the game board. If a player is unable to make a move, that player loses the game. Given the number of stones, find and print the name of the winner (i.e.,First or Second) on a new line. Each player plays optimally, meaning they will not make a move that causes them to lose the game if some better, winning move exists.

NOTE :- Try solving the problem using property of Grundy numbers to learn the concept. Original Problem :- Hackerrank

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each of the subsequent lines contains a single integer n , denoting the number of stones in a test case.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 100

Output Format
On a new line for each test case, print First if the first player is the winner; otherwise, print Second.
