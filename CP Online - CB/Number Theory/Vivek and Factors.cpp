Vivek and Factors

Vivek loves to play number games with his friend Ujjawal. One day they were playing a game where one of them will speak out a positive number and the other have to tell the sum of its factors. The first one to say it correctly wins. After a while they got bored and wanted to try out a different game. Vivek then suggested about trying the reverse. That is, given a positive number 'S' , they have to find a number whose factors add up to 'S'. Realizing that this task is tougher than the original task, Vivek came to you for help. Luckily Vivek owns a portable programmable device and you have decided to burn a program to this device. Given the value of 'S' as input to the program, it will output a number whose sum of factors equal to 'S' .

Input Format
There are several cases . Each case of input will consist of a positive integer 'S'<= 100000 . The last case is followed by a value of 0 .

Constraints
0 < S <= 10000

Output Format
print the integer whose factors sum is equal to 'S'. Print the largest Integer whose factors sum is 'S' . If no such number exists, output '-1' .

Sample Input
1
102
1000
0
Sample Output
1
101
-1
