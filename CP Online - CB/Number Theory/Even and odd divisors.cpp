/*
Even and odd divisors
Vivek likes to solve mathematical problems. So, Dheer tries to challenge him with a problem. But Vivek is quite busy these days, So he asks for your help.

The problem is as follows: You are given an integer q which denotes the number of queries. For each query, You are given an integer n. You have to find the result of number n.

The result of a number n is defined as the sum of even divisors of n minus the sum of odd divisors of n.

More Formally, result = (Sum of even divisors of n) - (Sum of odd divisors of n)

A divisor of a number n is defined as a positive integer i such that n is divisible by i.

Input Format
First line of input contains an integer q denoting the number of queries. After that q lines follow, Each line consists an integer n for which you have to find the value of result.

Note: Use fast input output as input is quite large;

Constraints
1 <= q <= 100000 1 <= n <= 100000

Output Format
You have to print q lines, where the output of the ith line is the result of the ith query.

Sample Input
2
3
6
Sample Output
-4
4
