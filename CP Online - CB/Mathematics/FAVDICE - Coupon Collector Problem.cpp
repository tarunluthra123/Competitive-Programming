/*
FAVDICE - Coupon Collector Problem
BuggyD loves to carry his favorite die around. Perhaps you wonder why it's his favorite? Well, his die is magical and can be transformed into an N-sided unbiased die with the push of a button. Now BuggyD wants to learn more about his die, so he raises a question:

What is the expected number of throws of his die while it has N sides so that each number is rolled at least once?

Input Format
The first line of the input contains an integer t, the number of test cases. t test cases follow.

Each test case consists of a single line containing a single integer N - the number of sides on BuggyD's die

Constraints
1 <= T <= 15 1 <= N <= 1000

Output Format
For each test case, print one line containing the expected number of times BuggyD needs to throw his N-sided die so that each number appears at least once. The expected number must be accurate to 2 decimal digits.

Sample Input
2
1
12
Sample Output
1.00
37.24
