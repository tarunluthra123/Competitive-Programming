/*
Painter's Partition Problem
Given K painters to paint N boards where each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit of boards i.e. if the length of a particular board is 5, it will take 5 units of time to paint the board. Compute the minimum amount of time to paint all the boards.

Note that:

Every painter can paint only contiguous segments of boards.
A board can only be painted by 1 painter at maximum.
Input Format
First line contains K which is the number of painters. Second line contains N which indicates the number of boards. Third line contains N space separated integers representing the length of each board.

Constraints
1 <= K <= 10 1 <= N <= 10 1<= Length Of Each Board <= 10^8

Output Format
Output the minimum time required to paint the board.

Sample Input
2

1 10
Sample Output
