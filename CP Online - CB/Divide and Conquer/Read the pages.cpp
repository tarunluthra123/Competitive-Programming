/*
READ THE PAGES
You are given N books, ith of which has Pi pages (Pi <= Pj, if i < j). You have to assign these N books to M students, such that each student has subsegment of books and the maximum number of pages assigned to a student is minimized.
You have to find the maximum number of pages, a student can have in this assignment of books.

Input Format:
First line contains integers, N and M, denoting the number of books and number of students respectively. Next line contains N integers, denoting the number of pages in N books.

Constraints:
1<=N<=10^5 1<=M<=N 1<=Pi<=10^9

Output Format
Print a single integer, denoting the answer.

Sample Input
4 2
10 20 30 40
Sample Output
60
