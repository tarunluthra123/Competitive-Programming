/*
Are They Same
This year when tourist visited India for snackdown 2017. He and Rajat started discussing few problems on divide and conquer. tourist asked Rajat that if you have 2 strings s1 and s2 can you find if they are equivalent. Rajat then asked the condition for being equivalent to which tourist replied

Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases:

They are equal. 2 .If we split string a into two halves of the same size a1 and a2, and string b into two halves of the same size b1 and b2, then one of the following is correct: 1 . a1 is equivalent to b1, and a2 is equivalent to b2 2 . a1 is equivalent to b2, and a2 is equivalent to b1
Rajat quickly solved the problem can you?

Input Format
First line is number of test cases t Then follow two strings each of same length

Constraints
1 <= test cases <= 10 1 <= string length <= 50000

Output Format
print "YES" if they are "equivalent" and "NO" if they are not

Sample Input
2
ababa
baaba
ab
ba
abc
abc
Sample Output
NO
YES
YES
Explanation
test case 1 : - you cannot split the string into two halves of same size and s1 != s2 hence they are not same
test case 2 :-  split ab as a and b and ba as b and a then conditon is fulfilled
test case 3 :-  they are already same
